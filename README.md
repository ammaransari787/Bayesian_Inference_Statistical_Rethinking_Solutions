# Bayesian_Inference_Statistical_Rethinking_Solutions
Solutions to Statistical Rethinking:  A Bayesian Course Using R and Stan by Richard McElreath (2nd Edition). 

I noticed when working through this book there was nowhere I could find to check my solutions for the 2nd edition, using the techniques covered in this book (as opposed to solutions found online using other packages, such as brms or PyMC). I wanted to post my solutions, so that if anyone else is working through the book using the rethinking package, they have a reference to look at for solutions for the 2nd edition solved in this manner.

Note that there are some solutions that are not posted becuase they were solved via pen/paper, instead of typed code, typically probability or math problems in the earlier chapters. I still have those solutions worked out, so if anyone is interested in those as well, feel free to reach out and I can either update the files by typing in solutions or provide scans of my written solutions.
